 * Name: sigset
 *
 * Description:
 *   The sigset() function will modify signal dispositions. The 'signo'
 *   argument specifies the signal. The 'disp' argument specifies the
 *   signal's disposition, which may be SIG_DFL, SIG_IGN, or the address
 *   of a signal handler. If 'disp' is the address of a signal handler, the
 *   system will add 'signo' to the calling process' signal mask before
 *   executing the signal handler; when the signal handler returns, the
 *   system will restore the calling process' signal mask to its state prior
 *   to the delivery of the signal.  'signo' will be removed from the calling
 *   process' signal mask.
 *
 *   NOTE:  The value SIG_HOLD for 'disp' is not supported.  It should work
 *   like this:  If 'disp' is equal to SIG_HOLD, 'signo' will be added to,
 *   not removed from, the calling process' signal mask and 'signo''s
 *   disposition will remain unchanged.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   signo - Identifies the signal to operate on
 *   disp  - The new disposition of the signal
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   Upon successful completion, sigset() will the previous disposition of
 *   the signal. Otherwise, SIG_ERR will be returned and errno set to
 *   indicate the error.
 *
 *   NOTE: sigset() would return SIG_HOLD if the signal had been blocked and
 *   the signal's previous disposition if it had not been blocked.
