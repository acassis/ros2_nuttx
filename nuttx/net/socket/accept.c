/****************************************************************************
 * Function: accept
 *
 * Description:
 *   The accept function is used with connection-based socket types
 *   (SOCK_STREAM, SOCK_SEQPACKET and SOCK_RDM). It extracts the first
 *   connection request on the queue of pending connections, creates a new
 *   connected socket with mostly the same properties as 'sockfd', and
 *   allocates a new socket descriptor for the socket, which is returned. The
 *   newly created socket is no longer in the listening state. The original
 *   socket 'sockfd' is unaffected by this call.  Per file descriptor flags
 *   are not inherited across an accept.
 *
 *   The 'sockfd' argument is a socket descriptor that has been created with
 *   socket(), bound to a local address with bind(), and is listening for
 *   connections after a call to listen().
 *
 *   On return, the 'addr' structure is filled in with the address of the
 *   connecting entity. The 'addrlen' argument initially contains the size
 *   of the structure pointed to by 'addr'; on return it will contain the
 *   actual length of the address returned.
 *
 *   If no pending connections are present on the queue, and the socket is
 *   not marked as non-blocking, accept blocks the caller until a connection
 *   is present. If the socket is marked non-blocking and no pending
 *   connections are present on the queue, accept returns EAGAIN.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *   sockfd   The listening socket descriptor
 *   addr     Receives the address of the connecting client
 *   addrlen  Input: allocated size of 'addr', Return: returned size of 'addr'
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *  Returns -1 on error. If it succeeds, it returns a non-negative integer
 *  that is a descriptor for the accepted socket.
 *
 * EAGAIN or EWOULDBLOCK
 *   The socket is marked non-blocking and no connections are present to
 *   be accepted.
 * EBADF
 *   The descriptor is invalid.
 * ENOTSOCK
 *  The descriptor references a file, not a socket.
 * EOPNOTSUPP
 *   The referenced socket is not of type SOCK_STREAM.
 * EINTR
 *   The system call was interrupted by a signal that was caught before
 *   a valid connection arrived.
 * ECONNABORTED
 *   A connection has been aborted.
 * EINVAL
 *   Socket is not listening for connections.
 * EMFILE
 *   The per-process limit of open file descriptors has been reached.
 * ENFILE
 *   The system maximum for file descriptors has been reached.
 * EFAULT
 *   The addr parameter is not in a writable part of the user address
 *   space.
 * ENOBUFS or ENOMEM
 *   Not enough free memory.
 * EPROTO
 *   Protocol error.
 * EPERM
 *   Firewall rules forbid connection.

 * Assumptions:
