 * Name: up_cpu_initialize
 *
 * Description:
 *   After the CPU has been started (via up_cpu_start()) the system will
 *   call back into the architecture-specific code with this function on the
 *   thread of execution of the newly started CPU.  This gives the
 *   architecture-specific a chance to perform ny initial, CPU-specific
 *   initialize on that thread.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   None
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   Zero on success; a negated errno value on failure.
